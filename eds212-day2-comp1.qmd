## Derivatives in R

Here are my notes!

```{r}
fx <- expression(3.1 * (x ^ 4) - 28 * x)

# This is storing the derivative expression
df_dx <- D(fx, 'x')

# This calls it back (show me!)
df_dx

x <- 10

eval(df_dx) # Evaluates derivative
```

You try! Find the slope of g(z) = 2z^3^ - 10.5z^2^ + 4.1 at z = 3.6

```{r}
gt = expression(2 * z ^ 3 - 10.5 * z ^ 2 + 4.1)

dg_dt = D(gt, 'z')

z = seq(from = 1, to = 3, length = 20)

eval(dg_dt)
```
